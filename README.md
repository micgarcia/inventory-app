# Inventory App

### Styling and Layout still in progress
The app is now live at the link below, however the CSS has not been completed so it is mainly barebones HTML at the moment.

#### Live App URL:

This app is an Inventory tracking app written using Express and Node.js. The backend was created with REST API principles in mind and users can Create,
Read, Update, and Delete inventory. The content is rendered on the server side using PUG view templates.
